Added :class:`~.api.roi.PolygonROI` and related functionality:

- Added the ROI :class:`~.api.roi.PolygonROI` to create ROIs of arbitrary shape.
- Added functions :func:`~.api.roi.combine_rois` and :func:`~.api.roi.mask_from_rois` to use multiple ROIs to slice signals and create masks, respectively. Currently only :class:`~.api.roi.PolygonROI` is supported.
