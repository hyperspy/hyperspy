Hyperspy provides a rich toolbox for hyperspectral data analysis: 

* Reads and writes multiple common formats in the electron microscopy and HDF5.
* Performs curve fitting on multidimensional datasets.
* Machine learning e.g. PCA, ICA...
* Easy to use and customise.
* Specially well suited for electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data analysis.

Hyperspy is open source (released under the revised GPL v3 license).

Currently it requires Python 2.7. Python 3 is not yet supported.
