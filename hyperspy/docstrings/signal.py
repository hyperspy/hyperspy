HISTOGRAM_BIN_ARGS = """bins : int or sequence of float or str, default "fd"
            If ``bins`` is an int, it defines the number of equal-width
            bins in the given range. If ``bins`` is a
            sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the rightmost
            edge, allowing for non-uniform bin widths.

            If ``bins`` is a string from the list below, will use
            the method chosen to calculate the optimal bin width and
            consequently the number of bins (see Notes for more detail on
            the estimators) from the data that falls within the requested
            range. While the bin width will be optimal for the actual data
            in the range, the number of bins will be computed to fill the
            entire range, including the empty portions. For visualisation,
            using the ``'auto'`` option is suggested. Weighted data is not
            supported for automated bin size selection.

            Possible strings are:

            - ``'auto'`` : Maximum of the 'sturges' and 'fd' estimators.
              Provides good all around performance.
            - ``'fd'`` : Freedman Diaconis Estimator, robust
              (resilient to outliers) estimator that takes into
              account data variability and data size.
            - ``'doane'`` : An improved version of Sturges' estimator
              that works better with non-normal datasets.
            - ``'scott'`` : Less robust estimator that that takes into
              account data variability and data size.
            - ``'stone'`` : Estimator based on leave-one-out cross-validation
              estimate of the integrated squared error. Can be regarded
              as a generalization of Scott's rule.
            - ``'rice'`` : Estimator does not take variability into account,
              only data size. Commonly overestimates number of bins required.
            - ``'sturges'`` : R's default method, only accounts for data size.
              Only optimal for gaussian data and underestimates number
              of bins for large non-gaussian datasets.
            - ``'sqrt'`` : Square root (of data size) estimator, used by Excel
              and other programs for its speed and simplicity.
            - ``'knuth'`` : Knuth's rule is a fixed-width, Bayesian approach to
              determining the optimal bin width of a histogram.
            - ``'blocks'`` : Determination of optimal adaptive-width histogram
              bins using the Bayesian Blocks algorithm."""

HISTOGRAM_MAX_BIN_ARGS = """max_num_bins : int, default 250
            When estimating the bins using one of the str methods, the
            number of bins is capped by this number to avoid a MemoryError
            being raised by :func:`numpy.histogram`."""

HISTOGRAM_RANGE_ARGS = """range_bins : (float, float), optional
            The lower and upper limit of the range of bins. If not provided,
            range is simply ``(a.min(), a.max())``. Values outside the range are
            ignored. The first element of the range must be less than or
            equal to the second. `range` affects the automatic bin
            computation as well. While bin width is computed to be optimal
            based on the actual data within `range`, the bin count will fill
            the entire range including portions containing no data."""

HISTOGRAM_WEIGHTS_ARGS = """weights : array_like, optional
            An array of weights, of the same shape as `a`.  Each value in
            `a` only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
            (instead of 1). This is currently not used by any of the bin estimators,
            but may be in the future."""
