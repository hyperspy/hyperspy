Hyperspy was started by Francisco de la Peña in 2007 under the EELSLab name.

In 2010 Stefano Mazzucco joined the project after we forked his dm3reader.

In 2011 Michael Sarahan joined the project contributing a large amount of code that he had independenly developed during the previous years.

Luiz Fernando Zagonel wrote the importRPL Digital Micrograph plugin to import Ripple files, providing an easy path to export data to Digital Micrograph.

The Hyperspy logo is a modified version of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg and the same GFDL license apply. Stefano Mazzucco got the idea for the logo and modified the original file.
