SUR and PRO format
------------------

This is a format developed by the digitalsurf company to handle various types of
scientific measurements data such as profilometer, SEM, AFM, RGB(A) images, multilayer
surfaces and profiles. Even though it is essentially a surfaces format, 1D signals
are supported for spectra and spectral maps. Specifically, this file format is used
by Attolight SA for its scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence
(SEM-CL) hyperspectral maps. Metadata parsing is supported, including user-specific
metadata, as well as the loading of files containing multiple objects packed together.

The plugin was developed based on the MountainsMap software documentation, which
contains a description of the binary format.
